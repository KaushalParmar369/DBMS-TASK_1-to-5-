# DBMS-TASK_1-to-5-

## Overview:-

These five tasks focused on SQL database management, covering database design, normalization, ERD creation, administration, and data warehousing. Each task provided hands-on experience with real-world scenarios, enhancing my skills in database construction, data analysis, and administration using tools like Microsoft Access, Visio, and SQL Server.


### **Task 1: Simple Database and Report**
- **Overview**: I developed a simple database using Microsoft Access and generated a report to summarize key data from the Orders Schema.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Created tables for customer orders and related entities, establishing accurate relationships.
  - Populated the tables with sample data (5 records per table).
  - Designed a summary report using the Report Wizard.
- **Skills**: Database Development, Referential Integrity, Report Design.


### **Task 2: Functional Dependencies**
- **Overview**: I analyzed functional dependencies in the CustomerOrder table and normalized it to 4th Normal Form (4NF).
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Identified primary, foreign, and candidate keys to refine table relationships.
  - Normalized the table to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
  - Drafted a report to address schema issues and clarify stakeholder concerns.
- **Skills**: Dependency Analysis, Data Normalization (4NF), Professional Communication.


### **Task 3: Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
- **Overview**: I created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) using Microsoft Visio to illustrate relationships in the Orders Schema.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Designed a detailed ERD with Crow’s Foot notation, mapping all entities and attributes.
  - Marked primary and foreign keys and accurately represented cardinality.
- **Skills**: ERD Design, Crow’s Foot Notation, Data Structure Relationships.


### **Task 4: Schema Control and Administration**
- **Overview**: I focused on schema creation and user access control for the Employee Database, ensuring proper data organization and security.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Designed schemas to classify data (e.g., personal and contact information) based on security needs.
  - Created dummy user accounts and assigned roles with specific access permissions for departments like HR and Accounting.
  - Configured and documented ODBC connections for secure database access.
- **Skills**: Schema Design, User Management, ODBC Configuration, Security.


### **Task 5: Data Warehouse and ETL**
- **Overview**: I designed a data mart for shipping performance analysis based on the Orders Database.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Created a star schema with a fact table and dimensional tables for shipping performance evaluation.
  - Wrote SQL scripts for table creation with constraints and composite keys.
  - Generated sample data to test the functionality of the data mart.
- **Skills**: Data Warehousing (Star Schema Design), SQL Scripting, ETL Concepts.


Each task built upon the previous one, enabling me to strengthen my database design, optimization, and administration skills. This project enhanced my ability to solve complex database issues while implementing efficient and secure solutions.
